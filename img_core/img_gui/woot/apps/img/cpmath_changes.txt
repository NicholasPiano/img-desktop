Some changes had to made to cpmath to integrate it into the code

1. We are operating in Python3 here, so Some definitions had to be changed in the Cython code
for cpmorphology such as PyInt_AsLong. as per: http://py3c.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference.html

  a. PyInt_AsLong -> PyLong_AsLong
  b. PyString_ToString -> PyUnicode_ToString
  c. Py_InitModule ->
    i. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28305731/compiler-cant-find-py-initmodule-is-it-deprecated-and-if-so-what-should-i

2. Path shenanigans

  a. cpmorphology, filter, index, setup, threshold import paths need to point to apps.img.cpmath

3. Run setup with "~$ python3 setup.py build_ext -i" as found in CellProfiler.build_extensions

4. Perimeter calculation is broken on line 2319 of cpmorphology as far as I can tell. I can just use
my own perimeter calculation for now.
