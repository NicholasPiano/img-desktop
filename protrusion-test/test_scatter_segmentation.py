# test_scatter_segmentation

from mod_base import *

# goal:
# 1. given the segmentation of zcomp, use each point in the mask as a new marker for segmentation in the brightfield
# 2. 

# method:
# 1. using bounding box defined in mod_base, cut images to size and export to directories for segmentation
# 2. run cell profiler
# 3. import images and categorize objects by protrusion length
# 4. plot results
